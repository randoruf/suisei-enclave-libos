Unlike other experimental research projects (e.g. [sgx-lkl](https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl)), [gramine](https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine) is being used in a few companies, for instance, [Tencent Cloud](https://www.tencentcloud.com/) and [JD Cloud](https://www.jdcloud.com/en/). It would be great if learning the libOS by reading the source code of gramine.
